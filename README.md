# Bamazon

Bamazon acts as a CLI for a store, with admin and client capabilities.
Remember to run npm install before trying out this app.

CLIENT SIDE

For the client side, start in the command line with:
  node Bamazon.js

Once you've started the program, simply follow the prompts to select the item(s) to purchase.
It will log out the invoice

ADMIN SIDE

For the admin side, start in the command line with:
  node bamazonManager.js

Your choices here are to look at stock, look at what's below 5 items, add existing stock, or add an entirely new item.

**From the look at what's low, remember to put in the amount you want in stock, not the amount you want to add. (In a future update, we'll implement an order up to level function that allows you to set default numbers of each item so that you can order back up to that much in stock)
